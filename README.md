# Dumpster Baby

Entry for Sonen Game Jam Autum 2015  
Theme: Abandoned

## Back story

Oh no! Your clumsy dad dropped you out the window.
Luckily you landed in a dumpster filled with all kinds of nice, soft trash.
It's cold and dark out here in the alley, so you'd better make your way back up the fire escape.
You just have to avoid touching those yucky rats, but you're a strong baby,
you can scare them off with your mighty ground slam.
